        <p class="about-section__strong">We are water experts in the United States.</p>
        <p class="about-section__description">Sparkle is completely natural and 'alive' water. We don't change the original consistency and texture of the water aiming to bottle and deliver it in a most natural state.</p>
        <p class="about-section__description-second">We keep all the original proportions of the minerals preserving what Mother Nature had created. Although we love to use technology to check and occasionally improve water's quality, our main goal is to maintain water in its most original state.</p>
